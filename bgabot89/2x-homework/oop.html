What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?

A constructor is a method called at the moment an object is instantiated. It usually has the same name as the class containing it. It is a method of the class. It's primarily used to set an object's properties or to call methods to prepare the object to use. 

Prototype-based programming is an OOP model, and unlike a constructor, it does not use classes, but rather it first accomplishes the behavior of any class and then reuses it.

// What is this inside a constructor
"This" defines the constructor. It refers to the current object, and lets you work with properties within the class.
